## Optimizations
To optimize this application, I would use Cloudinary to convert all user-submitted and current images to the webp format. I would also make the images responsive by using the srcset attribute with multiple width sizes. I would also apply lazy loading and decoding: "async" to non-essential images and media sources that are not part of the visible content on the page. The next optimizations I would make is reorganizing my CSS code by creating individual CSS pages for each EJS page, and a core style page that applies to all pages. This would make the code more reusable and maintainable.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the importance of using a structured and modular approach to structuring my codebase. Using MVC system architecture allowed me to organize my code and clearly separate the data, logic, and presentation layers of my app, making it more scalable, flexible, and maintainable. I also learned how to use the technologies of EJS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose to build a full-stack app, including features such as user authentication and data persistence. Overall, building this project was a challenging and rewarding experience that taught me a lot about web development, software engineering, and problem-solving.
